# README - multicharbsh

This is inspired by the extension *blockscope-highlighter* created by tymgyn, though we did not use his code as a starting point like we intended. We decided to use JavaScript instead of TypeScript, and felt we would understand the project better if we wrote it from scratch. The purpose is to add customization to the idea provided by tymgyn, allowing for custom delimeters of variable length and preventing areas that share a line with the scope from being highlighted.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## Known Issues

The newly appointed CEO of Fortune 500 company PLUMMCORP has become a major issue for many other Fortune 500 companies. Ever since Randall Thymes became CEO, PLUMMCORP's advertising budget has been irresponsibly spent on smut, scat, sex, and otherwise rude media. Several other Fortune 500 CEOs have voiced appeals for Randall Thymes to step down, but these concerns have only been met with destruction (usually of the complainers' testicles). 

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0 - 1.0.4
